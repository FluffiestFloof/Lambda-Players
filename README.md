# Lambda-Players

A project to rewrite Zeta Players with the goal to be as clean and optimized as possible.

Currently the project will only be located here on Github and will be seen on the workshop when the addon is in a decent state


# Custom Content 

### Profile Pictures
Custom Profile Pictures can be added by putting .png and .jpg images in this folder, `DRIVE:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\materials\lambdaplayers\custom_profilepictures` or `DRIVE:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\sourceengine\materials\lambdaplayers\custom_profilepictures` Note that you can create sub folders in custom_profilepictures containing images to be able to organize your image files. Recent update changes directory so profile pictures can be added by addon and be sent to a server's clients
